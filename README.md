## Description of the project

The AirBnB clone project starts now until...the end of the first year.The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
You won't implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.
After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:
* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a shell(perfect for development and debugging)
* A website(the front-end that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data(data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your date(retrieve, create, delete, update them)

for this third steps i make The SQL Storage in MYSQL
### SQL STORAGE

* Replace the file storage by a Database Storage
* map your models to a table in database by using an ORM
